Development roadmap:
* Movement 
    * Flesh out player movement
        * Jumping
    * Attack
    	* Basic melee attack
	* Basic ranged attack
* Interaction
    * Interact with object (i.e. chest, sign)
    * Interact with NPC (dialogue)


Things I'm going to want to look into for this project:
* [Using gridmaps](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.html)
* [Animating lots of things at once](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/tutorials/3d/vertex_animation/index.html)
